# Spam-SMS-Detection
Spam SMS detection is the process of identifying unsolicited and unwanted text messages sent to mobile phones. These messages often contain malicious links, phishing attempts, fraudulent promotions, or unwanted advertising. Detection methods utilize various techniques, including keyword filtering, Bayesian analysis, and machine learning algorithms. These methods analyze message content, sender information, and other factors to determine the likelihood of a message being spam. Effective spam detection is crucial for protecting users from fraud, malware, and privacy violations, ensuring a safer mobile experience.
# Key stages:-
Data Collection: Gathering a substantial dataset of labeled SMS messages (both spam and ham) is crucial for training and evaluating the detection model. Publicly available datasets or collaboration with telecom providers can be potential sources.

Data Preprocessing: This stage involves cleaning and preparing the data for the model. Common steps include removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, handling special characters, and stemming or lemmatizing words to reduce dimensionality.

Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the text messages is essential. These features could include word frequencies (Bag-of-Words), TF-IDF scores, n-grams, presence of specific keywords (e.g., "free," "win," "prize"), message length, and sender information.

Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm is a critical step. Popular choices include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

Model Training and Evaluation: The chosen model is trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Cross-validation techniques are often employed to ensure robust performance.

Deployment and Integration: Once a satisfactory model is developed, it can be deployed as a standalone application, integrated into an existing messaging platform, or used as a web service API for real-time spam detection.

System Monitoring and Improvement: Continuous monitoring of the system's performance and periodic retraining with new data are essential to maintain accuracy and adapt to evolving spam techniques.
